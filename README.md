# Slack quipbot

quipbot will supply devops and software related quips upon request. I am not the author of the quips, they are sourced 
from a variety of gists, including [devops Borat](https://gist.github.com/textarcana/676ef78b2912d42dbf355a2f728a0ca1).
No guarantees are provided on appropriateness of the quips.

This bot is a fork of https://github.com/slackapi/easy-peasy-bot.

## Usage
In Slack, invite the bot user to the room you want it to monitor. Then, provoke quips with messages like:
```
@<botname> quip
```

## Installing

## Running
After you've created a bot account on slack, grab the token, and run:

```bash
TOKEN="<your_secret> npm start"
```
